-Why is the South Region the clear sales leader, and what market factors can be replicated in the lower-performing regions?

-What specific event or campaign caused the sharp peak in sales in the month of June 2024?

-Which specific Region and Product combination in the donut chart (e.g., South-Desktop) contributes the single largest percentage to the total Sum of Profit?

-For the lowest-performing product (Mobile), is its low sales volume and profit proportional to its relatively low cost structure?

-What is the total sales contribution of the top two regions (South and East) as a percentage of the overall 24K Sum of Sales?

## ðŸ“Š Insights
-Desktop Dominance: The Desktop product is the clear leader in both Gross Sales and Absolute Profit, despite having the highest associated cost.

-Regional Imbalance: The South region significantly outperforms all other regions, indicating a strong need to investigate and replicate successful strategies in the East, West, and North.

-Seasonal/Event Volatility: Sales show a highly volatile trend in the first half of 2024, culminating in a sharp peak in June, suggesting performance is driven by specific, high-impact events or seasonal demand.

-High Profit Concentration: The donut chart shows that profit is likely concentrated in a few specific regional-product combinations, making the business potentially vulnerable to shifts in those narrow markets.

## âœ… Conclusion
The Sales Chart Dashboard provides a clear, actionable view of performance. The analysis highlights an operation heavily reliant on the Desktop product and the South region. The critical strategic priorities are to stabilize the monthly sales trend following the June peak and to develop targeted strategies to boost sales and profit in the North and West regions by applying lessons learned from the South and East.
